# 5.-Prototype-Based-Programming

Implement a class that describes a simple marker. The class should
be the following components:

• a field that stores the color of the marker;

• a field that stores the amount of ink in the marker (in percent);

• a method for printing (the method takes a string and prints the text
corresponding color; the text is displayed as long as in the marker
there is ink; one non-whitespace character is 0.5% of ink in
marker).

Implement a class that describes a refueling marker,
by inheriting it from a simple marker and adding a method for refueling
marker.

In the client part of the script, demonstrate the work of the methods
both classes.
